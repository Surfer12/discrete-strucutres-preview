First, fix class definition and structure issues:
Move the public classes (MathematicalOperationException, ParsingException, ValidationException) from DiscreteLogicException.java to their own properly named files
Delete the duplicate class files that are causing conflicts
Next, resolve ambiguous references:
Add proper imports with fully qualified names where types are ambiguous
Potentially refactor to avoid duplicate type definitions between packages
Then, implement missing interfaces correctly:
Fix classes that don't properly implement required interface methods
Correct return type mismatches in interface implementations
After that, address missing components:
Create the missing classes like AttentionRecognitionFramework
Implement required methods in existing classes
Finally, fix method call issues:
Correct incorrect method parameters and return types
Fix access violations for private methods/fields
Let's start with fixing the class definition issues as they're causing the most immediate problems. Would you like me to help you address those first?
