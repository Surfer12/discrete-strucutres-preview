Excellent! The build succeeded. Maven has successfully compiled all 40 source files, including your `DiscreteLogicCLI.java` and all its dependencies.
Now I need to rebuild the project with the corrected main class path:

mvn clean package

then

This will rebuild the JAR with the correct main class path. After that, you should be able to run:

java -jar target/discrete-logic-java-1.0.0.jar sets

Now you can run your CLI application. You have several options:

## Option 1: Run directly with Maven
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.discretelogic.app.DiscreteLogicCLI"
```

## Option 2: Run with arguments
For example, to see the help:
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.discretelogic.app.DiscreteLogicCLI" -Dexec.args="--help"
```

Or to run a specific command like truth-table:
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.discretelogic.app.DiscreteLogicCLI" -Dexec.args="truth-table 'A & B'"
```

## Option 3: Create an executable JAR
First, package your application:
```bash
mvn package
```

Then you can run it with:
```bash
java -jar target/discrete-logic-java-1.0.0.jar
```

Try running the help command first to see all available options:
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.discretelogic.app.DiscreteLogicCLI" -Dexec.args="--help"
