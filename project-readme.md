# Discrete Structures & Cognitive Flow

## Overview
This project explores the intersection of discrete mathematics, cognitive science, and fluid dynamics, with a particular focus on understanding and modeling flow states through discrete structures. By combining formal mathematical frameworks with cognitive processing models, we aim to create novel approaches to analyzing and understanding complex systems.
