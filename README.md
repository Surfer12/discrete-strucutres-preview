# Discrete Structures with Cognitive Flow Integration

## Project Overview

This project explores the intersection of discrete mathematics, cognitive science, and fluid dynamics through a comprehensive Java implementation. By combining formal mathematical frameworks with cognitive processing models, we aim to create novel approaches to analyzing and understanding complex systems.
